# GameOverPopUp_with_highscore
This repo contains two React.js exercises aimed at understanding component usage and props.



Exercise 1 - GameOverPopup:
I've created a React component named `GameOverPopup`, functioning as a popup displayed when the game is over. The component utilizes props to display the player's name, score, and the cause of death. You can customize the appearance and content of the popup and use it in various game-related scenarios.

Exercise 2 - Highscore:
I've developed a `Highscore` component that showcases a list of top scores. The component uses props to receive data about players and their scores, using map function to dynamically generate list elements (loop through the high score-list array). This component is useful to display and update high-score tables in your web applications.


Both exercises are created within the context of a React application and are intended to deepen understanding of component-based development and how to utilize props to send data to components.
